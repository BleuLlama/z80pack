Version 2 & 3 of RDOS use the upper 4 programmed input switches
for boot options as follows:

Switch 4: off - detect terminal baud rate, have to hit return
          on  - fixed baudrate, no need to hit return a few times

Switch 5: off - boot from floppy disk devices
          on  - boot from harddisk devices

Switches 6 & 7 select the device number, both off = device 0 (A:),
switch 7 on = device 1 (B:), and so on.

The autoboot feature of RDOS is set by a dip switch on the FDC cards.
We don't have that, so I routed it to programmed input switch 0.
Off = autoboot, On = get into RDOS. This also works with RDOS 1.

The cpmtools definition for the 5.25" SSSD format used by Cromemco is:

diskdef cro5sd
  seclen 128
  tracks 40
  sectrk 18
  blocksize 1024
  maxdir 64
  skew 5
  boottrk 3
  os 2.2
end

If you label disks with CDOS stat/l and use anything different than
64 directory entries, the definition needs to be changed appropriate.
