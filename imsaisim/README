The monitor/boot ROM's (mpu-a-rom.hex and mpu-b-rom.hex) are full featured
monitor programs. They first check if there is a disk in drive A:. If a disk
is present the boot code loads the first sector and executes it, which will
boot the operating system on the disk.

If there is no file disks/drivea.dsk present, the programs loop on all
possible input ports. Type a space character in the terminal window to get
at the prompt.

For the MPU-A ROM:
IMSAI IEEE MONITOR    VERS 1.0
?

For the MPU-B ROM:
IMSAI MPU-B MONITOR    VERS 1.3
?

The monitor has lots of commands, B will try to boot from disk, D dumps memory
and so on. With R 0 1 it will read track 0 sector 1 into memory. The W command
writes a sector to the disk! Become familar with this before trying,
because writing some random bytes to the boot disk will make it unusable.
The manual for MPU-B has a detailed description of all monitor commands.
For booting both version will work, the monitor commands probably
have differences.
