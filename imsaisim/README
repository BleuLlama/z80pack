The bootloader (bootrom.hex) is a full featured monitor program. It first
checks if there is a disk in drive A:. If a disk is present it loads the
first sector and executes it, which will boot IMDOS.

If there is no file disks/drivea.dsk present, the program loops on all
possible input ports. Type a space character to get it's greeting and
prompt:

IMSAI IEEE MONITOR    VERS 1.0
?

The monitor has lots of commands, b will try to boot from disk, d dumps memory
and so on. With r 0 1 it will read track 0 sector 1 into memory. The w command
writes a sector to the disk! Become familar with this before trying,
because writing some random bytes to the boot disk will make it unusable.

On disk A: there are two BIOSnn.SYS files that were included on the IMDOS
disk images. I don't know for which I/O devices they were assembled, the OS
is build from BIOS.MAC on disk B:, so that the line printer port is used
and the IOBYTE assigned appropriate. If you want to modify the BIOS a new OS
is created with:

	a:
	m80 b:bios,b:bios=b:bios/m
	pip a:bios.sys=b:bios.rel
	genesys
