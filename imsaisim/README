The bootloader (bootrom.hex) is a full featured monitor program. It first
checks if there is a disk in drive A:. If a disk is present it loads the
first sector and executes it, which will boot IMDOS.

If there is no file disks/drivea.dsk present, the program loops on all
possible input ports. Type a space character to get it's greeting and
prompt:

IMSAI IEEE MONITOR    VERS 1.0
?

The monitor has lots of commands, b will try to boot from disk, d dumps memory
and so on. With r 0 1 it will read track 0 sector 1 into memory. The w command
writes a sector to the disk! Become familar with this before trying,
because writing some random bytes to the boot disk will make it unusable.
